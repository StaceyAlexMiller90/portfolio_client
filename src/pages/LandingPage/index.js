          we also definitely share your pain. Nothing beats that good old sound
          of the needle hitting that fine record you just dug... on the other
          hand,there is nothing worse then buying doubles, not finding records
          whilst you were almost certain you had it (or did you?) and losing
          track of that precious hobby you have going on.

          <br></br> Organise your collection by simply taking a picture of your
          sleeve, uploading it on Recordnise and adding it into your online
          collection. You can even see how rich you could have been.
