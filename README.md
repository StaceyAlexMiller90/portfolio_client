RECORDNISE is a way to digitalise your record collection. The app relies on both the GOOGLE cloud vision API & the DISCOGS database API for easy referencing on records based just on an image upload from your shelf.

The goal of this project is to create something I am interested in, that showcases all of the skills I have learned so far as a trainee full stack developer.
I also wanted to experiment with new technologies & API's.

This app is still a work in progress, suggestions for improvements are always welcome!

### THE PROBLEM

As a DJ or music lover with an extensive vinyl collection, I am unable to browse my collection quickly & I often forget what I have! I wish there was an easy way to digitalise my collection.

### USER STORIES

- As a DJ or music lover I would like to easy browse through my record collection without getting covered in dust
- As a DJ or music lover I need to be able to add my records quickly using image upload otherwise it becomes too time consuming to use
- As a DJ or music lover I want the app to already guess the record rather than having to manually type it in
- As a DJ or music lover I would like to see an interesting summary of my record collection & be able to share this with my friends
- As a DJ or music lover I would like to get inspiration from others collections \* coming soon
