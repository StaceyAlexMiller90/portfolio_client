### Overview

RECORDNISE is a way to digitalise your record collection. The app relies on both the GOOGLE cloud vision API and the DISCOGS database API for easy referencing on records based just on an image upload from the sleeve.

The goal of this project is to create something I am interested in - (I live for music), that showcases all of the skills I have learned so far as a trainee full stack developer.

I also wanted to experiment with new technologies and API's that I didn't use before.

This app is still a work in progress, suggestions for improvements are always welcome!

#### Some reflections and things I plan to add or improve on.

- I plan to separate all genres/styles/artists into their own database tables. Currently they are stored in the records table as a string
- I would like to add a feature for users to follow eachother and view eachothers collections
- I would like to add some pagination for when the collection gets large
- I would like to tweak the search results to try to make it more accurate.
- I would like to add a details page where you can listen via youtube and view a tracklist - I already pull this information from the discogs database

### THE PROBLEM

As a DJ or music lover with an extensive vinyl collection, I am unable to browse my collection quickly and I often forget what I have! I wish there was an easy way to digitalise my collection.

### USER STORIES

As a DJ or music lover...

- I would like to easy browse through my record collection digitally
- I need to be able to add my records quickly using image upload otherwise it becomes too time consuming to use
- I want the app to already suggest the record rather than having to manually type it in
- I would like to see an interesting summary of my record collection e.g. value, most common genre etc.
- \* coming soon \* I would like to get inspiration from others collections
